   * Request Information, accessible to Interceptors.
   * <p>
   * Each interception point is given an object through which the 
   * Interceptor can access request information. Client-side and server-side 
   * interception points are concerned with different information, so there 
   * are two information objects: <code>ClientRequestInfo</code> is passed 
   * to the client-side interception points and <code>ServerRequestInfo</code>
   * is passed to the server-side interception points. But there is 
   * information that is common to both, so they both inherit from a common 
   * interface: <code>RequestInfo</code>.
   *
   * @see ClientRequestInfo
